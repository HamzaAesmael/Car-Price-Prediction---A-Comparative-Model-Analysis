**Project Overview**
The goal of this project is not just to predict car prices, but to perform a comprehensive analysis of different regression techniques. We start with simple models and progressively build more complex ones, observing their performance on both seen (training) and unseen (testing) data.

The project demonstrates a typical machine learning workflow:

1) Data loading and preparation.

2) Building baseline models.

3) Identifying a common pitfall (overfitting) with complex models.

4) Implementing a solution (regularization) to create a robust, generalizable model.


**Key Concepts Demonstrated**
This project showcases a range of fundamental data science and machine learning skills:

1) Data Cleaning & Preparation: Using pandas for data manipulation.

2) Simple & Multiple Linear Regression: Building baseline predictive models.

3) Polynomial Regression: Creating more complex, non-linear models.

4) Overfitting vs. Underfitting Analysis: Diagnosing model performance issues.

5) Ridge Regression (L2 Regularization): A key technique to prevent overfitting.

6) Hyperparameter Tuning: Finding the optimal alpha value for Ridge Regression.

7) Cross-Validation: Ensuring model stability and reliability.

8) Model Evaluation: Using metrics like R-squared (RÂ²) to assess performance.

9) Data Visualization: Using matplotlib and seaborn to interpret model results visually.
